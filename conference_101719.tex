\begin{abstract}
With the movement away from passwords towards more cryptographically secure methods, SSH public/private keypairs have become more prevalent amongst technologists. When hardening a new Linux or Unix server, one of the first tasks is to disable password authentication, reducing the attack vector of an actor brute forcing logins against the host. However, while the use of SSH keys reduces brute force attacks, it does not reduce the threat of key compromise and leakage (e.g., the commit of a keypair to SCM, etc.) or a bad attacker injecting their own public key into an environment for lateral movement. The concept of a signed SSH keys allows a known and trusted source to cryptographically “sign” and scope a user’s SSH key, which can then be used to access a specific environment or host as a pre-determined user for a short period of time. This paper will identify how the use of a signed SSH keys increases auditability of users in a shared/multi-tenant environment, reduces the lateral movement by a bad actor, and decreases the blast radius if a keypair is leaked.

\section{Introduction}
SSH (Secure Shell) keypairs are one of the most secure ways to authenticate to a system when using the SSH protocol. Traditionally to access a system users would authenticate using a username and password combination, which only provides one factor authentication (something you know). If a user’s credentials were accessed by a bad actor (through a phishing attempt, credential dump, password crack, etc.) that actor would be able to trivially impersonate the original user and access the system with their full un-scoped entitlements. When using an SSH keypair, a user now theoretically has two factors of authentication (provided the user “secures” their private keypair with a password), as a bad actor would now need to acquire a user’s private key file and the password to decrypt the key to access a secured system (something you have, and something you know). However, just like passwords, SSH keypairs are often reused by users between multiple services and systems, therefore creating a single point of compromise and an increased blast radius should that credential fall out of control of the intended user.

In terms of managing SSH keys from an infrastructure point of view, a user’s public portion of the keypair must be installed into each system which they need to access (typically by the user themselves), creating a circular dependency on the use of passwords to install the public key, which means password authentication must be supported. Additionally, this management style does not scale in large distributed systems where a user might need to access several hundred hosts at any point, and the public keypair could be removed during a repave event where a host is recreated for configuration drift, deployment, or security/compliance purposes.

The author of this paper proposes the use of a “signed” SSH keypair as an alternative to password- based authentication and/or the use of a traditional SSH keypair. By using a signed SSH keypair, a user wanting to access a system would present their intent and public key to a trusted and authoritative system which would cryptographically sign and issue a short lived (and scoped) certificate to the user which would be trusted by each host through the use of a Root Certificate Authority (CA). This approach dramatically decreasing the management overhead needed to manage individual user’s SSH public keys on individual hosts, increases auditability by creating an independent and immutable system recording the “signing” of a keypair to access a particular system, and decreasing the blast radius if a user’s private key was compromised by a bad actor.

\section{Hypothesis}
As discussed earlier, SSH keys are extremely vulnerable to leakage and are high touch in terms of management across large scale distributed environments. For example, if a user is part of an application development team which needs access to 6 or 7 different hosts (across different data centers, environments, etc.) the user’s SSH public key must be manually added to each different server either manually or other automation. Additionally, if the user leaves the team, the other owners of the team must delete and remove that user’s key from the host, or risk them having unauthorized access. In a traditional scenario, a first-time user would login with a username/password/keyboard authentication method and add their keys to the authorized\_keys file in their home directory. With the proposed solution of Signed SSH keys, entitlements for accessing these hosts is now externalized to a third-party system (e.g., Active Directory, Okta, Keycloak, etc.) where permissions can easily be added or dropped (and audited) as the role of the user changes.

In the flow described below, we assume the organization leverages Active Directory as their directory manager of choice, and the user has been added to the appropriate groups within the directory. When the user needs to access a protected resource (e.g., a database server), they will first authenticate to the authorization server (using either OAuth2 or SAML) which first authenticates and later authorizes the user based on their roles within the directory, and produce a JSON Web Token (JWT) with their roles \& claims. The user will then use the JWT to authenticate to an application which has access to a trusted Certificate Authority, which will then sign the user’s provided key with a very short time to live (TTL). The need for the “Signer Application” is that we don’t want the user to have direct access to the private key of the Certificate Authority (CA) – otherwise, they would be able to sign any keypair, and possibly even issue certificates (depending on shared usage of the CA). Upon a successful signing, the user is returned a signed certificate from the application, which they will then use as part of the authentication process to the SSH protected resource.

The typical solution in terms of SSH Keypairs is to use phrases on top of SSH Keypairs, however, this does not solve the entirety of the scenario. Typically, applications will run on a host as a “service” or “shared” account, and for users to access this shared account, multiple users (entities) will drop their SSH Public Key into the authorized\_keys file so that they can log into the box as that user. However, the signed SSH keys removes the need for authorized\_keys, and enables better audit control and logging as to which entity logged onto a host as a shared interactive account.

% \section{Ease of Use}

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
